## What are the different types of sorting algorithm:

# Sorting algorithms are methods used to order the elements of a list in a specific sequence (most commonly in ascending or descending order). They are fundamental in computer science for optimizing data handling and improving efficiency. Here are some of the most commonly used types of sorting algorithms:

*Bubble Sort*: A simple comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order. This process is repeated until no swaps are needed, which means the list is sorted. It is known for its simplicity but is inefficient for large datasets.
*Selection Sort*: This algorithm segments the list into two parts: sorted and unsorted. It repeatedly removes the smallest element of the unsorted segment and appends it to the sorted segment. Like Bubble Sort, it is quite inefficient for large datasets.
*Insertion Sort*: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. However, it has advantages for small data sets and nearly sorted lists.
*Merge Sort*: A divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves. It is very efficient and has a consistent running time, but requires additional space proportional to the array size.
*Quick Sort*: Another divide and conquer algorithm that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quicksort that pick pivot in different ways. It has better space complexity than merge sort and is often faster in practice.
*Heap Sort*: Based on a binary heap data structure. It creates a max heap from the array and then repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap, and replaces it with the last element of the heap followed by re-adjusting the heap. It is very efficient and does not require additional array storage.
*Radix Sort*: Implements a digit by digit sort starting from least significant digit to most significant digit. Radix sort uses counting sort as a subroutine to sort.
*Bucket Sort*: Distributes the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sort algorithm.
Each of these algorithms has its own pros and cons, and the choice of sorting algorithm can depend on the size and nature of the data, as well as specific performance requirements.

Here's a comparison of the sorting algorithms mentioned in a tabular format:

Radix Sort	      O(nk)	                    O(nk)	                         O(nk)	            O(n+k)	      Yes	    No

Key:
n: Number of elements in the array
k: The range of the input
Stable: Sorting algorithm is stable if it preserves the relative order of equal elements
In-place: Sorting algorithm is in-place if it uses a constant amount of extra space
